# ADR 0001 – Choose Bicep for Landing Zone Baseline

**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** We need human‑readable IaC with first‑class Azure support and native tooling.  
**Decision:** Use **Bicep** over raw ARM or Terraform for the starter baseline.  
**Consequences:** Tight Azure integration and simpler authoring; Terraform can be added later with equivalent modules.
